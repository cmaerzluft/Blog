## The Idea

Welcome to my first blog entry! I was going to do a quick introduction followed by an equally quick mini-analysis but then I started doing said analysis and it kept getting bigger and bigger as I thought of more things to add and explore... instead I am just writing this introduction and doing the fun stuff elsewhere. So, the quick rundown is this: I hope to use this blog to share my passion for data science by reaching two types of readers.  

The first group I would like to reach is everyone. Data science is used to answer pretty much everything these days. I want to show people how data science is done on real data and real problems as well as explain why it works. To be clear, this blog is about the methods and tools behind data science, but I aspire to write and discuss topics in a way that is accessible to all. "If you can't explain it simply, you don't really understand it" - [Richard Feynman](https://kottke.org/17/06/if-you-cant-explain-something-in-simple-terms-you-dont-understand-it).

The second reader I would like to reach are fellow data scientists. While I want everyone to understand what is going on in general, I want the people who are interested to be able to see under the hood and learn the more intricate details. If you are interested in the code and the technical aspects, I hope that this is the place for you more so than for the average person.  

Obviously, creating the type of content that reaches both these groups of people will be very difficult to create. I am really not sure how it will go. For one thing, as I am sure you may have already noticed, I am not the best writer in the world. It likely won't work the way I have idealized it in my head but, at the end of the day, I'm also doing all of this for a third group - me. I want to continue to learn and push my skills as a professional. Having this type of outlet gives me a product to work toward so that I can see my growth as a data scientist in practical term. If no one else reads any of these posts, I will still learn a lot and be better for it.
  
So... Thanks for being here and all that. Talk to you soon.
