# Biography

At UCLA, while studying Economics I stumbled upon a Statistics class and fell in love. I was drawn to the methods (particularly programming in R) and to the range of fields I could now explore. The beauty of data science, to me, is the freedom it provides to explore questions not just in Economics but in Politics, in Sociology, in sports, and many other areas. Data science allows me to ask questions in any field and gives me the skills to answer those questions. 

Since graduating I have taken my passion to the RAND Corporation where I am currently a Research Programmer. While I work on a wide variety of projects, I have become quite experienced in questions related to recruiting. One area of data science that I have become quite adept at is the building and deployment of interactive tools built using the Shiny package in R.

While my professional life centers around data science and R, my personal life is a little bit more varied. My hobbies include running, cooking and going to Disneyland among many other things. I could go into great detail on all these areas of my life and I probably will later, but for now I just wanted to give a quick flavor for who I am.
