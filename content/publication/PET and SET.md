abstract = "The Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) program currently accounts for about two-thirds of Regular Army officer production. As student populations shift and resources tighten, both the productivity and location of ROTC units must be monitored to ensure that the Army attracts and commissions highly-qualified officers. This report presents research on the development and application of two new strategic planning tools. Using the Reserve Officers' Training Corps Program Evaluation Tool (ROTC-PET), planners can evaluate existing ROTC programs by simulating scenarios that include up to six strategic objectives and their relative priorities, as well as the degree to which current programs can expand the number of commissions. To help guide selection of new hosts or new participants in existing programs, the ROTC Selection Evaluation Tool (ROTC-SET) allows planners to evaluate the production potential of schools not currently hosting or those not participating in ROTC programs. The ROTC-SET also gives users the ability to specify a variety of possible objectives and constraints. The authors recommend that the Army use these new strategic planning tools to help meet near-term officer production goals and longer-term strategic objectives for its ROTC program."
