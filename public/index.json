[{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"If I Were a Betting Man… I recently listened to a story on the podcast for Moth Radio Hour. The speaker, Annie Duke, described how she came to be in a high stakes game of Texas Hold’em with nine of the other world’s best poker players. As a part of her story she mentioned that she first started playing poker when her brother, one of the other nine players at the high stakes game, on a small cocktail napkin gave her a small list of hands which she could play when she first started. He said, “stick to these hands and you will be fine”. As with most stories I hear, I wanted to know more.\nNow if you aren’t familiar with the Texas Hold’em you can find a nice summary of the game and its rules here. In that link you will even find a list of probabilities for being dealt certain grouping of pocket cards. What that list is missing though is the true value of the hands.\nThe holy grail of Texas Hold’em is the royal flush. This hand comes from making a suited straight starting with a ten and finishing with an ace. The list of probabilities in the above link show that the probability of getting two cards that are suited and connected and help create royal flush (e.g. 10/Jack, Jack/Queen, etc.) is 1%. The probability of completing the royal flush is even higher: 0.000154%. In other words, if you are waiting for this hand, you are in the wrong game. So if this hand is so rare, which hands are more common but still worth playing which hands actually result in wins. If you were a world class poker player which hands would you rely on the most, which ones would you put on a small cocktail napkin?\n The Deal The answer to the question above can have many answers. For this analysis we are going to keep it simple. We are simply going to ask, which starting hole cards end up winning the most games in the long run. In order to do this, we will simulate a hand of poker with eight players. We will track what card each player has and who ends up winning if no player folds their hands. After this we will play another hand, and another, and another; we will do this thousands of times or more until we feel confident that we have found the hands most likely to result in wins.\n# Libraries Needed library(knitr) # Load Data load(\u0026quot;~/Desktop/Miscellaneous/Data Blog/TexasHoldEm/Output/simulated_5000_games.Rdata\u0026quot;) print(summary(games)) ## iter player_id pocket_card1 pocket_card2 ## Min. : 1 Min. :1.00 Length:40000 Length:40000 ## 1st Qu.:1251 1st Qu.:2.75 Class :character Class :character ## Median :2500 Median :4.50 Mode :character Mode :character ## Mean :2500 Mean :4.50 ## 3rd Qu.:3750 3rd Qu.:6.25 ## Max. :5000 Max. :8.00 ## flop_card1 flop_card2 flop_card3 ## Length:40000 Length:40000 Length:40000 ## Class :character Class :character Class :character ## Mode :character Mode :character Mode :character ## ## ## ## turn_card river_card high_pocket both_high_pocket ## Length:40000 Length:40000 Mode :logical Mode :logical ## Class :character Class :character FALSE:14942 FALSE:34223 ## Mode :character Mode :character TRUE :25058 TRUE :5777 ## ## ## ## suited_pocket paired_pocket value_distance straight_pocket ## Mode :logical Mode :logical Min. : 0.000 Mode :logical ## FALSE:30653 FALSE:37667 1st Qu.: 2.000 FALSE:17800 ## TRUE :9347 TRUE :2333 Median : 4.000 TRUE :22200 ## Mean : 3.962 ## 3rd Qu.: 6.000 ## Max. :11.000 ## final_hand_points final_hand hand_place winner ## Min. :9.880e+02 Length:40000 Min. :1.0 Mode :logical ## 1st Qu.:1.009e+04 Class :character 1st Qu.:2.5 FALSE:34464 ## Median :1.023e+04 Mode :character Median :4.5 TRUE :5536 ## Mean :7.663e+20 Mean :4.5 ## 3rd Qu.:1.022e+07 3rd Qu.:6.5 ## Max. :1.000e+25 Max. :8.0  ","date":1536624000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536624000,"objectID":"70a88b666b9676fabea1437c8e5b59e1","permalink":"/post/simple-poker/","publishdate":"2018-09-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/simple-poker/","section":"post","summary":"If I Were a Betting Man… I recently listened to a story on the podcast for Moth Radio Hour.

This report describes a recruit selection tool that estimates prospective outcomes and costs for different combinations of recruits' cognitive, noncognitive, demographic, physical, and behavioral attributes. The tool assesses the effects of multiple, simultaneous changes in the selection of prospects on losses during the first term, on the incidence of certain adverse personnel actions, and on specific reasons for early separation from the Army. This enables the Army to identify potential changes to selection of youth based on a variety of attributes in order to expand supply smartly or to decrease the rates of targeted adverse outcomes, and to strategically examine trade-offs in outcomes and costs associated with changes in the characteristics of the recruit cohort.","tags":[],"title":"Prospective Outcome Assessment for Alternative Recruit Selection Policies","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"The Idea. Welcome to my first blog entry! I was going to do a quick introduction followed by an equally quick mini-analysis but then I started doing said analysis and it kept getting bigger and bigger as I thought of more things to add and explore… So instead I am just writing this introduction and doing the fun stuff elsewhere. So the quick rundown is this: I hope to use this blog for two purposes. The first purpose is primarily a self-serving one and will only be useful to the data scientists in the audience.\nI hope to use this site to document some of the more technical aspects of my job. There isn’t always a guide for what I do and each problem can be done many ways - especially with respect to programming. I have often found help and sometimes even full solutions to coding challenges within a blog and I hope to return that help to someone else.\nThe second purpose of this blog is the primary reason I am creating it and is the opposite of the first purpose. While, sharing code and solving technical challenges is important, the primary goal of data science, the skill that separates an OK data scientist from a great one is the ability to share their work with non-data people. In my biography section, I said “Data science allows me to ask questions in any field … [and] to answer those questions”, so I’m going to. When I can, I will explore concepts that are generally relevant to a larger audience and do my best to explain it and the data science that goes on behind it. Topics can include anything where data is available (though on occasion I will probably want to discuss certain topics and why they can’t easily be examined from time to time as well).\nSo… Thanks for being here and all that. Now, let’s have some fun.\n ","date":1535500800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535500800,"objectID":"a0e3d1be5acc4be3a3d9cf0e9b6f191f","permalink":"/post/welcome/","publishdate":"2018-08-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/welcome/","section":"post","summary":"The Idea.

A theoretical model was estimated based on the Army's recruiting experience. Using this model, a tool was created for the Army's use in assessing alternative courses of action and optimizing resource levels and mix under alternative enlisted accession goals, labor market conditions, and recruit eligibility policies. Understanding how recruiting resources and recruit eligibility policies work together as a system under varying recruiting requirements and environments is critical for decisionmakers who want to use their limited resources to efficiently and effectively achieve the Army's accession requirements. The recruiting resource model developed in this report considers the relationship among the monthly level and mix of recruiting resources, recruit eligibility policies, accumulated contracts, and training seat targets. It models how these factors combine to produce monthly accessions and the number of enlistment contracts at the fiscal year's end that are scheduled to access in the following fiscal year.","tags":[],"title":"Resources Required to Meet the U.S. Army's Enlisted Recruiting Requirements Under Alternative Recruiting Goals, Conditions, and Eligibility Policies","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\u0026hellip;\n","date":1530169200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530169200,"objectID":"18d05a63a1c8d7ed973cc51838494e41","permalink":"/privacy/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/privacy/","section":"","summary":"\u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Privacy Policy","type":"page"},{"authors":["Nelson Lim","Bruce R.

As student populations shift and resources tighten, both the productivity and location of ROTC units must be monitored to ensure that the Army attracts and commissions highly-qualified officers. This report presents research on the development and application of two new strategic planning tools. Using the Reserve Officers' Training Corps Program Evaluation Tool (ROTC-PET), planners can evaluate existing ROTC programs by simulating scenarios that include up to six strategic objectives and their relative priorities, as well as the degree to which current programs can expand the number of commissions. To help guide selection of new hosts or new participants in existing programs, the ROTC Selection Evaluation Tool (ROTC-SET) allows planners to evaluate the production potential of schools not currently hosting or those not participating in ROTC programs. The ROTC-SET also gives users the ability to specify a variety of possible objectives and constraints. The authors recommend that the Army use these new strategic planning tools to help meet near-term officer production goals and longer-term strategic objectives for its ROTC program.","tags":[],"title":"Strategic Planning Tools for the Army Senior Reserve Officers' Training Corps Program","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ries, Charles P.","Marco Hafner","Troy D.
