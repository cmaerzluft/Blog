[{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"If I Were a Betting Man… I recently listened to a story on the podcast for Moth Radio Hour. The speaker, Annie Duke, described how she came to be in a high stakes game of Texas Hold’em with nine of the other world’s best poker players. As a part of her story she mentioned that she first started playing poker when her brother, one of the other nine players at the high stakes game, on a small cocktail napkin gave her a small list of hands which she could play when she first started. He said, “stick to these hands and you will be fine”. As with most stories I hear, I wanted to know more.\nNow if you aren’t familiar with the Texas Hold’em you can find a nice summary of the game and its rules here. In that link you will even find a list of probabilities for being dealt certain grouping of pocket cards. What that list is missing though is the true value of the hands.\nThe holy grail of Texas Hold’em is the royal flush. This hand comes from making a suited straight starting with a ten and finishing with an ace. The list of probabilities in the above link show that the probability of getting two cards that are suited and connected and help create royal flush (e.g. 10/Jack, Jack/Queen, etc.) is 1%. The probability of completing the royal flush is even higher: 0.000154%. In other words, if you are waiting for this hand, you are in the wrong game. So if this hand is so rare, which hands are more common but still worth playing which hands actually result in wins. If you were a world class poker player which hands would you rely on the most, which ones would you put on a small cocktail napkin?\n The Deal The answer to the question above can have many answers. For this analysis we are going to keep it simple. We are simply going to ask, which starting hole cards end up winning the most games in the long run. In order to do this, we will simulate a hand of poker with eight players. We will track what card each player has and who ends up winning if no player folds their hands. After this we will play another hand, and another, and another; we will do this thousands of times or more until we feel confident that we have found the hands most likely to result in wins.\n# Libraries Needed library(knitr) # Load Data load(\u0026quot;~/Desktop/Miscellaneous/Data Blog/TexasHoldEm/Data/simulated_100k_games.Rdata\u0026quot;) print(summary(games)) ## iter player_id pocket_card1 pocket_card2 ## Min. : 1 Min. :1.00 Length:800000 Length:800000 ## 1st Qu.: 25001 1st Qu.:2.75 Class :character Class :character ## Median : 50000 Median :4.50 Mode :character Mode :character ## Mean : 50000 Mean :4.50 ## 3rd Qu.: 75000 3rd Qu.:6.25 ## Max. :100000 Max. :8.00 ## flop_card1 flop_card2 flop_card3 ## Length:800000 Length:800000 Length:800000 ## Class :character Class :character Class :character ## Mode :character Mode :character Mode :character ## ## ## ## turn_card river_card high_pocket both_high_pocket ## Length:800000 Length:800000 Mode :logical Mode :logical ## Class :character Class :character FALSE:299079 FALSE:685274 ## Mode :character Mode :character TRUE :500921 TRUE :114726 ## ## ## ## suited_pocket paired_pocket value_distance straight_pocket ## Mode :logical Mode :logical Min. : 0.00 Mode :logical ## FALSE:612163 FALSE:753041 1st Qu.: 2.00 FALSE:355980 ## TRUE :187837 TRUE :46959 Median : 4.00 TRUE :444020 ## Mean : 3.96 ## 3rd Qu.: 6.00 ## Max. :11.00 ## final_hand_points final_hand hand_type ## Min. :9.081e+08 Length:800000 Length:800000 ## 1st Qu.:1.040e+10 Class :character Class :character ## Median :1.111e+10 Mode :character Mode :character ## Mean :1.657e+10 ## 3rd Qu.:2.121e+10 ## Max. :9.141e+10 ## hand_name hand_place winner ## Length:800000 Min. :1.000 Mode :logical ## Class :character 1st Qu.:2.000 FALSE:688698 ## Mode :character Median :4.000 TRUE :111302 ## Mean :4.357 ## 3rd Qu.:6.000 ## Max. :8.000  ","date":1536624000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536624000,"objectID":"70a88b666b9676fabea1437c8e5b59e1","permalink":"/post/simple-poker/","publishdate":"2018-09-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/simple-poker/","section":"post","summary":"If I Were a Betting Man… I recently listened to a story on the podcast for Moth Radio Hour.

This report describes a recruit selection tool that estimates prospective outcomes and costs for different combinations of recruits' cognitive, noncognitive, demographic, physical, and behavioral attributes. The tool assesses the effects of multiple, simultaneous changes in the selection of prospects on losses during the first term, on the incidence of certain adverse personnel actions, and on specific reasons for early separation from the Army. This enables the Army to identify potential changes to selection of youth based on a variety of attributes in order to expand supply smartly or to decrease the rates of targeted adverse outcomes, and to strategically examine trade-offs in outcomes and costs associated with changes in the characteristics of the recruit cohort.","tags":[],"title":"Prospective Outcome Assessment for Alternative Recruit Selection Policies","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"The Idea. Welcome to my first blog entry! I was going to do a quick introduction followed by an equally quick mini-analysis but then I started doing said analysis and it kept getting bigger and bigger as I thought of more things to add and explore… instead I am just writing this introduction and doing the fun stuff elsewhere. So, the quick rundown is this: I hope to use this blog to share my passion for data science by reaching two types of readers.\nThe first group I would like to reach is everyone. Data science is used to answer pretty much everything these days. I want to show people how data science is done on real data and real problems as well as explain why it works. To be clear, this blog is about the methods and tools behind data science, but I aspire to write and discuss topics in a way that is accessible to all. “If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t really understand it” - Richard Feynman.\nThe second reader I would like to reach are fellow data scientists. While I want everyone to understand what is going on in general, I want the people who are interested to be able to see under the hood and learn the more intricate details. If you are interested in the code and the technical aspects, I hope that this is the place for you more so than for the average person.\nObviously, creating the type of content that reaches both these groups of people will be very difficult to create. I am really not sure how it will go. For one thing, as I am sure you may have already noticed, I am not the best writer in the world. It likely won’t work the way I have idealized it in my head but, at the end of the day, I’m also doing all of this for a third group - me. I want to continue to learn and push my skills as a professional. Having this type of outlet gives me a product to work toward so that I can see my growth as a data scientist in practical term. If no one else reads any of these posts, I will still learn a lot and be better for it.\nSo… Thanks for being here and all that. Talk to you soon.\n ","date":1535500800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535500800,"objectID":"a0e3d1be5acc4be3a3d9cf0e9b6f191f","permalink":"/post/welcome/","publishdate":"2018-08-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/welcome/","section":"post","summary":"The Idea.

A theoretical model was estimated based on the Army's recruiting experience. Using this model, a tool was created for the Army's use in assessing alternative courses of action and optimizing resource levels and mix under alternative enlisted accession goals, labor market conditions, and recruit eligibility policies. Understanding how recruiting resources and recruit eligibility policies work together as a system under varying recruiting requirements and environments is critical for decisionmakers who want to use their limited resources to efficiently and effectively achieve the Army's accession requirements. The recruiting resource model developed in this report considers the relationship among the monthly level and mix of recruiting resources, recruit eligibility policies, accumulated contracts, and training seat targets. It models how these factors combine to produce monthly accessions and the number of enlistment contracts at the fiscal year's end that are scheduled to access in the following fiscal year.","tags":[],"title":"Resources Required to Meet the U.S. Army's Enlisted Recruiting Requirements Under Alternative Recruiting Goals, Conditions, and Eligibility Policies","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\u0026hellip;\n","date":1530169200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530169200,"objectID":"18d05a63a1c8d7ed973cc51838494e41","permalink":"/privacy/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/privacy/","section":"","summary":"\u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Privacy Policy","type":"page"},{"authors":["Nelson Lim","Bruce R.

As student populations shift and resources tighten, both the productivity and location of ROTC units must be monitored to ensure that the Army attracts and commissions highly-qualified officers. This report presents research on the development and application of two new strategic planning tools. Using the Reserve Officers' Training Corps Program Evaluation Tool (ROTC-PET), planners can evaluate existing ROTC programs by simulating scenarios that include up to six strategic objectives and their relative priorities, as well as the degree to which current programs can expand the number of commissions. To help guide selection of new hosts or new participants in existing programs, the ROTC Selection Evaluation Tool (ROTC-SET) allows planners to evaluate the production potential of schools not currently hosting or those not participating in ROTC programs. The ROTC-SET also gives users the ability to specify a variety of possible objectives and constraints. The authors recommend that the Army use these new strategic planning tools to help meet near-term officer production goals and longer-term strategic objectives for its ROTC program.","tags":[],"title":"Strategic Planning Tools for the Army Senior Reserve Officers' Training Corps Program","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ries, Charles P.","Marco Hafner","Troy D.
