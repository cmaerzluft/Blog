[{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":" Poker! I Barely Know her! I recently listened to a story on the podcast for Moth Radio Hour. The speaker, Annie Duke, described how she came to be in a high stakes game of Texas Hold’em with nine of the other world’s best poker players. If you aren’t familiar with the Texas Hold’em you can find a nice summary of the game and its rules here. As a part of her story she mentioned that she first started playing poker when her brother, one of the other nine players at the high stakes game, encouraged her to start playing professionally. When she expressed hesitation he wrote on a small cocktail napkin a list of hands which she should focus on as she began to play. He said, “stick to these hands and you will be fine.” In the podcast she didn’t reveal what those hands were but this is the kind of problem data science is well suited (I already hate myself for saying that) to handle.\nIn fact, Texas Hold’em can be used to study every facet of data science if we wanted to. You most likely expect this post to be used to explore the concept of probability, the most fundamental part of statistics, but I am not going to do that for this specific post. Instead, I want to focus on something much more mundane but just as vital to any data scientist.\nData Yep, it’s right there in the name. The joke within the data community is that data-science/statistics/economics/whatever-field-that-uses-data is actually only 10% analysis and 90% data cleaning and data management. All the probability knowledge in the world is useless to a data scientist without good data. As they say, “Garbage in, garbage out.”\nFortunately, finding good data really isn’t a matter of whether it exists or not. The real question is, do you have the time and/or money to put it in the form you need to perform the analysis you want? As an environment rich with oppotunities of data analysis the topic of poker has an incredibly large amount of data, some of it free and some of it for a price. If you google “texas holdem data” the first two links, a StackExchange post and a Kaggle dataset, are examples of great resources for finding data online. Now, we just need to decide if any of this data helps us answer which hands were on that napkin for Annie’s story.\nBefore we get to more complex analyses, I would like to build a naive understanding of the way Texas Hold’Em works. For the time being I want to know, if you take betting strategy (game theory) out of the equation which hands are more likely to win? In other words, how often do hands win when stacked up against every other hand. Unfortunately, none of the data in the links above are set up for this analysis. For one, I am cheap and don’t want to pay for any data but another reason is that many of the free data sets only give data on hands that were revealed at the end of a round. So if someone went all in and everyone else folded, the data might not tell us what anyone, even the person who won the pot, had at all. When we turn to the more complex question this won’t necessarily be a bad thing but for now we need to figure something else out. At this point there are only two alternatives; We can either turn this post around and go back to discussing probability and combinatorics or we can do something much more data science-y and just make everything up. # Libraries Needed # library(knitr) # # Load Data # load(\u0026quot;~/Desktop/Miscellaneous/Data Blog/TexasHoldEm/Data/simulated_100k_games.Rdata\u0026quot;) # print(summary(games)) Talk to you soon.\n  ","date":1563235200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563235200,"objectID":"d732eb8fd63ff300ef827318269550dc","permalink":"/post/intro-poker-data/","publishdate":"2019-07-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/intro-poker-data/","section":"post","summary":"Poker!

This report describes a recruit selection tool that estimates prospective outcomes and costs for different combinations of recruits' cognitive, noncognitive, demographic, physical, and behavioral attributes. The tool assesses the effects of multiple, simultaneous changes in the selection of prospects on losses during the first term, on the incidence of certain adverse personnel actions, and on specific reasons for early separation from the Army. This enables the Army to identify potential changes to selection of youth based on a variety of attributes in order to expand supply smartly or to decrease the rates of targeted adverse outcomes, and to strategically examine trade-offs in outcomes and costs associated with changes in the characteristics of the recruit cohort.","tags":[],"title":"Prospective Outcome Assessment for Alternative Recruit Selection Policies","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":" The Idea Welcome to my first blog entry! I was going to do a quick introduction followed by an equally quick mini-analysis but then I started doing said analysis and it kept getting bigger and bigger as I thought of more things to add and explore… instead I am just writing this introduction and doing the fun stuff elsewhere. So, the quick rundown is this: I hope to use this blog to share my passion for data science by reaching two types of readers.\nThe first group I would like to reach is everyone. Data science is used to answer pretty much everything these days. I want to show people how data science is done on real data and real problems as well as explain why it works. To be clear, this blog is about the methods and tools behind data science, but I aspire to write and discuss topics in a way that is accessible to all. “If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t really understand it” - Richard Feynman.\nThe second reader I would like to reach are fellow data scientists. While I want everyone to understand what is going on in general, I want the people who are interested to be able to see under the hood and learn the more intricate details. If you are interested in the code and the technical aspects, I hope that this is the place for you more so than for the average person.\nObviously, creating the type of content that reaches both these groups of people will be very difficult to create. I am really not sure how it will go. For one thing, as I am sure you may have already noticed, I am not the best writer in the world. It likely won’t work the way I have idealized it in my head but, at the end of the day, I’m also doing all of this for a third group - me. I want to continue to learn and push my skills as a professional. Having this type of outlet gives me a product to work toward so that I can see my growth as a data scientist in practical term. If no one else reads any of these posts, I will still learn a lot and be better for it.\nSo… Thanks for being here and all that.

A theoretical model was estimated based on the Army's recruiting experience. Using this model, a tool was created for the Army's use in assessing alternative courses of action and optimizing resource levels and mix under alternative enlisted accession goals, labor market conditions, and recruit eligibility policies. Understanding how recruiting resources and recruit eligibility policies work together as a system under varying recruiting requirements and environments is critical for decisionmakers who want to use their limited resources to efficiently and effectively achieve the Army's accession requirements. The recruiting resource model developed in this report considers the relationship among the monthly level and mix of recruiting resources, recruit eligibility policies, accumulated contracts, and training seat targets. It models how these factors combine to produce monthly accessions and the number of enlistment contracts at the fiscal year's end that are scheduled to access in the following fiscal year.","tags":[],"title":"Resources Required to Meet the U.S. Army's Enlisted Recruiting Requirements Under Alternative Recruiting Goals, Conditions, and Eligibility Policies","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\u0026hellip;\n","date":1530169200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530169200,"objectID":"18d05a63a1c8d7ed973cc51838494e41","permalink":"/privacy/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/privacy/","section":"","summary":"\u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Privacy Policy","type":"page"},{"authors":["Nelson Lim","Bruce R.

As student populations shift and resources tighten, both the productivity and location of ROTC units must be monitored to ensure that the Army attracts and commissions highly-qualified officers. This report presents research on the development and application of two new strategic planning tools. Using the Reserve Officers' Training Corps Program Evaluation Tool (ROTC-PET), planners can evaluate existing ROTC programs by simulating scenarios that include up to six strategic objectives and their relative priorities, as well as the degree to which current programs can expand the number of commissions. To help guide selection of new hosts or new participants in existing programs, the ROTC Selection Evaluation Tool (ROTC-SET) allows planners to evaluate the production potential of schools not currently hosting or those not participating in ROTC programs. The ROTC-SET also gives users the ability to specify a variety of possible objectives and constraints. The authors recommend that the Army use these new strategic planning tools to help meet near-term officer production goals and longer-term strategic objectives for its ROTC program.","tags":[],"title":"Strategic Planning Tools for the Army Senior Reserve Officers' Training Corps Program","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ries, Charles P.","Marco Hafner","Troy D.
