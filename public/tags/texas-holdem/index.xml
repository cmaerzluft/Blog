      <description>Poker! I Barely Know her! I recently listened to a story on the podcast for Moth Radio Hour. The speaker, Annie Duke, described how she came to be in a high stakes game of Texas Hold’em with nine of the other world’s best poker players. If you aren’t familiar with the Texas Hold’em you can find a nice summary of the game and its rules here. As a part of her story she mentioned that she first started playing poker when her brother, one of the other nine players at the high stakes game, encouraged her to start playing professionally.</description>
