#  Not Just a Statistic

This is the code for the Not Just a Statistic blog. If you want to learn more about this read the blogdown book for R. That is where I started and I can't really improve on what they said.

This code will change constantly so I don't recommend getting too attached to it. Any post I create that has code or data to look at will be stored in a different repository. Those repositories will be linked in the appropriate blog post.
